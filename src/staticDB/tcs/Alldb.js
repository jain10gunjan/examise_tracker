While firms have always had significant market power over their workers, what has changed recently is the weakening of collective bargaining, which allows workers to challenge powerful firms in wage negotiations.\n2. Some ascribe continued low industrial wages to the concentration of power in the hands of a few firms, but this is only part of the story.\n3. Since the 1980s, politicians have been freeing one side of the labor market in the name of competition – by restricting the power of trade unions – but doing very little about the power of firms.\n4. Wages are also affected by firms colluding tacitly: an estimated one in five jobs in the US is now covered by a 'non-compete' clause, which restricts workers from moving to rival firms.",
