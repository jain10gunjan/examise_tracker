        "question": "A cylindrical water tank has a radius of 7 meters and a height of 10 meters. If the tank is filled with water to a height of 8 meters, what is the volume of water in the tank? (Use π = 3.14)",
        "options": {
            "A": "431.2 cubic meters",
            "B": "862.4 cubic meters",
            "C": "1232.0 cubic meters",
            "D": "1752.8 cubic meters"
        },
        "correct_option": "C",
        "solution": "The volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula: Volume = π * (radius^2) * height\n\nGiven, radius = 7 meters, height (total height of the tank) = 10 meters, height of water = 8 meters.\n\nVolume of water in the tank = π * (7^2) * 8 = 3.14 * 49 * 8 = 1232.0 cubic meters.\n\nTherefore, the volume of water in the tank is 1232.0 cubic meters."
